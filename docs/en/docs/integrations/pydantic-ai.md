# Pydantic AI

`community` · `experimental`

The adapter connects a Pydantic AI Agent to a running PowerContext Server. It provides Memory tools,
automatic context preparation, and optional event capture. Its API and behavior are experimental.

## Install from source

Add the Client and adapter from the same ref to your application environment. The examples use OpenAI:

```bash
uv add "powercontext[client] @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master"
uv add "powercontext-pydantic-ai @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master#subdirectory=integrations/pydantic-ai"
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]>=2.29,<3"
```

Start a separate Server from the same ref using [Install and run](../get-started/install-and-run.md).
The adapter requires `powercontext[client]>=0.0.3`; use the matching current source for these examples.
For another provider, replace the `openai` extra and model string.

## Attach the preview capability

The example below uses OpenAI. For another provider, install the matching `pydantic-ai-slim` provider extra and
change the model string.

Attach the capability to an Agent:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from powercontext_pydantic_ai import PowerContext

agent = Agent(
    "openai:gpt-5.2",
    capabilities=[PowerContext()],
)
```

The capability adds `powercontext_search`, `powercontext_remember`, and `powercontext_context`. It also requests
`prepare_context` from the latest textual user prompt and prepends at most one untrusted evidence block per run. A new
run prepares context again even when it starts from the previous run's message history.

Use only the toolset when automatic preparation and capture are not wanted:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from powercontext_pydantic_ai import PowerContextToolset

agent = Agent("openai:gpt-5.2", toolsets=[PowerContextToolset()])
```

## Set environment configuration

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:17429
export POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_TOKEN=opaque-server-token
```

| Variable | Default | Validation and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:17429` | HTTP(S), without credentials, query, or fragment |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | `false` | Explicitly permit non-loopback plaintext HTTP |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_TOKEN` | unset | Bare printable token stored as `SecretStr` |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_SCOPE_ID` | unset | Existing explicit Server Scope, up to 256 characters; unset selects the Server default |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Positive seconds |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_MAX_BYTES` | `8000` | `512` to `32768` prepared-context bytes |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_CAPTURE_EVENTS` | `false` | Opt in to visible event capture |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_CAPTURE_CHECKPOINT_EVERY` | `5` | `1` to `100` successful events per flush |
| `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES` | `8192` | `512` to `32768` UTF-8 bytes per event |

Unlike the Codex and Claude Code plugin settings that accept a complete authorization value, this adapter accepts a
bare token. Do not include `Bearer ` or pass a complete `Authorization` header; the public Client adds the scheme.

Loopback HTTP is allowed by default; non-loopback HTTP requires the opt-in above or
`PowerContextSettings(allow_insecure_http=True)`. HTTPS certificate validation stays enabled. See
[Connect to a remote Server](../operate/connect-remote-server.md) for common environment settings and endpoint-bound
saved consent. The framework adapter does not have a setup installer.

Both `PowerContext` and `PowerContextToolset` accept a `PowerContextSettings` instance, a stable `id` (default
`powercontext`), and a fixed or callable `scope_id`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from powercontext_pydantic_ai import PowerContext, PowerContextSettings

settings = PowerContextSettings(timeout=5, max_bytes=4096)


def tenant_scope(ctx: RunContext[dict[str, str]]) -> str:
    return ctx.deps["powercontext_scope_id"]


capability = PowerContext(settings=settings, scope_id=tenant_scope)
```

The callback runs once per Agent run. Scope precedence is constructor string or callback, then environment `SCOPE_ID`.
The adapter sends that explicit ID, or `None`, to `resolve_scope_binding` once per run and reuses the returned Scope ID
for every recall, capture, flush, and tool call in that run. Explicit IDs must identify existing Server Scopes; when
no ID is configured, the Server default is selected. The adapter does not inspect cwd, Git metadata, or paths to
create Scope IDs.

## Decide whether to capture events

Capture is off by default. Set `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_CAPTURE_EVENTS=true` only when sending the initial user text,
visible model text and tool calls, and completed tool arguments and results to the configured scope is acceptable.
Thinking/reasoning content is excluded. Events are redacted for credential-like keys and known environment/Codex
credentials, rendered within the configured byte limit, and stored under
`powercontext.pydantic-ai-capture-event/v1`.

Every successful Capture advances the run-local Source position. A checkpoint Flush runs after the configured number
of captures, and `after_run` flushes any remaining Source. Parallel tool results receive unique sequence numbers under
a run-local lock. Recall, Capture, and Flush fail open during Server failures; explicit tool failures become
`ModelRetry`. The first HTTP 401 or 403 logs one credential-free configuration warning.

Captured project content can remain sensitive after credential redaction. Protect the Server, scope, database, and
logs accordingly.

## Compare the MCP fallback

Connecting PowerContext MCP requires no adapter package, but it is a lower-capability option for Pydantic AI. MCP
provides explicit tools; it does not automatically call `prepare_context`, capture trajectory events, or Flush at
checkpoints and run completion.

The preview supports ordinary Pydantic AI runs. Durable execution through Temporal, DBOS, Prefect, or similar systems
is not yet validated. Handoff, Candidate Review, Experience, and Skill operations are not included.
