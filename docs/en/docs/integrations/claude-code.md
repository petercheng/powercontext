# Claude Code

`community`

## Check prerequisites

Install PowerContext and Claude Code first, and make sure both commands are available in the environment that will
run setup:

```bash
powercontext --version
claude --version
```

Use the same PowerContext repository ref for the Python package and plugin. The Hook validates a versioned Prepared
Context contract, so mixing an older Server with a newer plugin can disable recall without blocking Claude Code.

## Install or update the plugin

First generate configuration and start the Server through [Quick Start](../get-started/quickstart.md).
On the Claude Code machine, load the client file:

```bash
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
powercontext setup claude-code --server-url "$POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SERVER_URL"
```

Before changing Claude Code settings, setup reports the settings entry, plugin cache, persistent data location,
required permissions, and exact rollback commands. It then registers or refreshes the Marketplace, updates or installs
the plugin at user scope, and verifies the enabled plugin through Claude Code's JSON output.

Claude Code owns the Marketplace registry, versioned plugin cache, and plugin data directory. Claude 2.1.133 does not
accept configuration flags on `plugin install`, so setup atomically merges `server_url` and `capture_prompts` into
the user-level `pluginConfigs` after installation while preserving unrelated settings; on failure it restores the
pre-install snapshot. PowerContext resolves these locations from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or Claude Code's default
configuration directory.

For a local checkout, pass its directory:

```bash
powercontext setup claude-code --source ./powercontext
```

After installation, confirm the Server is running, check the plugin, and open a new Claude Code session:

```bash
powercontext doctor claude-code
claude
```

Use `/hooks` to confirm the `UserPromptSubmit` Hook and `/mcp` to confirm the `powercontext` Server.
These are separate capture/recall and explicit-tool connections; both must work. `doctor claude-code` primarily checks
installation state. Complete the [Source and Topic check](../get-started/quickstart.md#4-verify-topic-memory-with-ordinary-conversation) to verify memory behavior.

For a new Scope, run the creation request in `.env.next-steps.md`, write the returned real `scope_id` to
`POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SCOPE_ID` in `.env`, reload it, and start a new session. The planned
`claude-code-xxxxxxxx` title is not an ID. Agent names and working directories do not automatically isolate data.
Load `.env` on the client. It contains the complete installation configuration, so copy it only to trusted machines.

MCP uses setup's persisted `server_url`, while `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SERVER_URL` can override the Hook.
After changing that environment URL, also update the persisted connection with matching-source setup and `--server-url`.
Both the Hook and MCP headersHelper need `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_AUTHORIZATION` from the client environment.
Desktop or other launch methods may not inherit terminal variables; restart the Claude process you actually use after changes.

Running setup again updates the plugin configuration and verifies the installed version. It does not remove existing
PowerContext Server data.

## Understand the plugin behavior

For each user prompt, the Hook:

1. resolves the current Scope from explicit, session, workspace, and default bindings;
2. calls `POST /v1/context/prepare` at most once;
3. strictly validates `powercontext.prepared-context.v1` and injects it unchanged through `additionalContext`;
4. independently captures the prompt as ordinary Content Source evidence.

The Source pipeline may later extract Memory when a generation model is configured. Prompt capture does not call
`remember_memory`, and the Hook never labels an ordinary prompt as `task-outcome`.

The plugin does not install a `Stop` Hook in v1. It does not read the transcript or automatically capture Claude's
final response. Memory writes and durable Handoff milestones remain explicit MCP operations guided by the bundled
Skill.

Scope resolution uses this order:

1. `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SCOPE_ID`, when explicitly set;
2. a durable session binding stored by PowerContext;
3. a durable workspace binding stored by PowerContext;
4. the Server's default Scope.

Bind a known Scope to the checkout with the bundled resolver:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace_scope.py" \
  --cwd "$PWD" --bind-scope "SCOPE_ID"
```

The resolver hashes the workspace path only as an external binding key. It never generates a Scope ID from a Git
remote or directory. Set an explicit Scope only when that separation or sharing is deliberate.

## Use explicit Memory and Handoff operations

The bundled MCP Server exposes the existing PowerContext operations. Claude can search and list Memory, and can
create, revise, or retire an entry when the user explicitly asks to persist a change.

For a task transfer, the bundled Skill guides Claude to prepare current work with `handoff_current_work` and, for an
explicit imperative such as “handoff this work,” pass the returned `handoff` unchanged to `commit_handoff`. The
receiver uses `continue_handoff` with the exact Revision, verifies it, and records an `acknowledge_handoff` receipt;
completed work uses `record_task_outcome` with that receipt. A Prepared Handoff is temporary, while an exact Revision
is the durable cross-agent transfer point.

Automatic recall does not depend on Claude deciding to call MCP. Conversely, MCP Memory writes do not replace prompt
capture: the Hook stores each enabled prompt as ordinary Source evidence, and the Server decides whether later Source
processing produces Memory.

## Configure the Server endpoint and prompt capture

Set the endpoint during setup:

```bash
powercontext setup claude-code \
  --server-url http://127.0.0.1:9000 \
  --no-capture-prompts
```

Claude Code stores these non-sensitive options in its user `pluginConfigs`. You can also override the Hook process for
one launch:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000
export POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_CAPTURE_PROMPTS=false
claude
```

Use `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SCOPE_ID` only when the current work must intentionally override durable bindings and the
Server default.

`POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_FLUSH_ON_CAPTURE=true` makes the Hook wait for Source processing and is intended for tests, not
normal interactive use.

The timeout and flush controls are listed in the
[configuration reference](#environment-variables). They apply to the Hook process; the MCP
client remains managed by Claude Code.

## Connect an authenticated Server

Start the Server with its token loaded from your secret manager:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_ACCESS_MODE=enforced
export POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN="$POWERCONTEXT_LOCAL_TOKEN"
powercontext server run
```

Start Claude Code from an environment containing the matching complete header:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer $POWERCONTEXT_LOCAL_TOKEN"
claude
```

The Hook reads this process environment value directly, while the MCP configuration expands it into the
`Authorization` header. The MCP header defaults to an empty value when the variable is absent. Never put the token in
the Server URL, plugin options, `.mcp.json`, Source metadata, or logs.

Plain HTTP is allowed on loopback by default. For a non-loopback Server, use HTTPS or explicitly set
`POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true`. Guided setup can save this consent and configure both the Hook and
native MCP URL; the host's own MCP policy still applies. See [Connect to a remote Server](../operate/connect-remote-server.md).

## Understand failure behavior

Recall and capture are independent and fail open. A failed recall does not prevent prompt capture, and a failed
capture does not remove valid recalled context. In every case Claude Code continues processing the current prompt.

| Condition | Hook behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Empty Prepared Context | Injects nothing and records the `empty` outcome |
| HTTP 401 | Injects nothing and records `authentication_failed` |
| HTTP 404 | Injects nothing and records `version_mismatch` |
| HTTP 503 or unavailable Server | Injects nothing and records `server_unavailable` |
| Unknown schema, malformed JSON, or oversized response | Injects nothing and records `invalid_response` |

Diagnostics contain the outcome and safe numeric metadata only. They omit the prompt, scope, prepared content,
Authorization value, and response body. The plugin rejects redirects and enforces both response-size and wall-clock
limits.

## Diagnose or roll back

Check the CLI and enabled plugin without contacting the Server:

```bash
powercontext doctor claude-code
```

If setup fails after creating a new Marketplace or plugin entry, it removes only the objects created by that setup
call. A Marketplace or plugin that existed before setup is preserved. Rerun setup after correcting the reported
Claude CLI or repository error; the operation is safe to repeat.

Remove the plugin and Marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall powercontext@powercontext --scope user
claude plugin marketplace remove powercontext
```

Uninstalling the plugin from its last scope also removes its `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` directory unless Claude Code is
run with `--keep-data`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SERVER_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:17429` | Server base URL used by the Hook |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | `false` | Explicitly permit non-loopback plaintext HTTP for PowerContext requests |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_SCOPE_ID` | unset | Override durable bindings and the Server default Scope |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_AUTHORIZATION` | unset | Complete `Bearer <token>` header for Hook and MCP requests |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_CAPTURE_PROMPTS` | `true` | Capture user prompts as ordinary Source evidence |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_FLUSH_ON_CAPTURE` | `false` | Wait for Source processing after capture |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `1` | Per-request Hook timeout |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_HTTP_BUDGET_SECONDS` | `4` | Shared Hook HTTP budget for recall, capture, and optional flush |
| `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_FLUSH_MAX_CALLS` | `4` | Maximum flush calls per prompt; valid values are 1 through 16 |

`powercontext setup claude-code` stores `server_url` and `capture_prompts` as non-sensitive Claude Code plugin
options. The corresponding `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_*` variables take precedence for the process that starts Claude Code.
Authorization is environment-only and must not be added to the Server URL or plugin options.

The outer `UserPromptSubmit` Hook timeout is ten seconds. Recall and capture use one shared wall-clock budget but fail
independently. HTTPS certificate validation remains enabled when HTTP is explicitly permitted. Restart Claude Code
after changing its environment.
