# Hermes

`community`

The integration contains a standard Hermes `MemoryProvider` and a standalone slash-command plugin. Hermes remains
responsible for the conversation and memory lifecycle; the provider sends recall, capture, and explicit operations to
a separately running PowerContext Server. The companion registers `/pc` and `/powercontext` before the provider is
activated. Backend failures do not interrupt the Hermes conversation.

## Prerequisites

- Hermes Agent 0.20.4 or newer, available on `PATH`;
- PowerContext CLI and Server installed from `master`;
- a running PowerContext Server.

```bash
uv tool install --force "powercontext[cli,server] @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master"
powercontext server run
```

## Install both plugins

In another terminal, install or refresh both plugins from the matching revision:

```bash
powercontext setup hermes
powercontext doctor hermes
```

The setup command copies the provider to `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/powercontext`, installs
`$HERMES_HOME/plugins/powercontext-command`, and enables the companion without granting built-in tool override
permissions. It does not start the Server or select the provider in Hermes.

Run the Hermes memory setup wizard and select `PowerContext`:

```bash
hermes memory setup
```

On Hermes 0.20.4, use the generic command above. `hermes memory setup powercontext` selects the provider but does not
open its configuration wizard. Restart Hermes after setup.

## Verify recall and writes

```bash
hermes powercontext status
hermes powercontext remember preference "The user prefers uv"
hermes powercontext search "Python package manager"
```

Inside an interactive Hermes session, `/pc status` should reach the same active provider. Use `/pc ` followed by
Tab/Down to inspect the available Memory, Handoff, Experience, Skill, review, statistics, trace, and Scope
commands. Hermes 0.20.4 does not provide enough invocation context to route gateway slash commands safely, so the
companion rejects gateway invocations; use the provider's Hermes tools in gateway sessions.

The provider uses `http://127.0.0.1:17429` by default. The Server resolves an explicit Scope first, then durable session
and workspace bindings, and finally its default Scope. Hermes hashes the workspace path only as an external binding
key; it does not generate Scope IDs from profiles, users, repositories, or directories.

## Configure the connection

The wizard writes non-sensitive settings to `$HERMES_HOME/powercontext/config.json`. Environment variables override
the file:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_CONFIG` | Config file path; defaults to `$HERMES_HOME/powercontext/config.json` |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_BASE_URL` | PowerContext Server URL |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | Explicitly permit non-loopback plaintext HTTP; defaults to `false` |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_AUTHORIZATION` | Complete authorization header, such as `Bearer <token>` |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_TOKEN` | Bare-token shorthand used when `AUTHORIZATION` is absent |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_SCOPE_ID` | Explicit server-owned Scope ID |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_MAX_BYTES` | Maximum prepared-context size, from 512 to 32768 bytes |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_TIMEOUT` | HTTP request timeout in seconds |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_CAPTURE_TURNS` | Capture completed turns as Sources |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_FLUSH_ON_SESSION_END` | Run Memory extraction at session end |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_CAPTURE_PRE_COMPRESS` | Capture filtered new turns before compression; disabled by default |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_EVALUATION_TRACE` | Record recalled context in sensitive local JSONL traces; disabled by default |
| `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_EVALUATION_TRACE_PATH` | Override the evaluation trace directory |

Let the Hermes wizard store authorization in its protected `.env` secret store; do not put the token in
`config.json`. Plain HTTP is allowed on loopback by default; use HTTPS for remote access or explicitly set
`POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true`. This does not disable HTTPS certificate validation. See
[Connect to a remote Server](../operate/connect-remote-server.md) for guided setup and endpoint-bound saved consent.
Evaluation traces contain prompts and recalled context; keep them local and protect them as sensitive data.

## Enable automatic extraction only when needed

Completed-turn capture creates Source evidence. It does not create Memory by itself. Automatic Source-to-Memory
extraction requires a generation model on the Server:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_INFERENCE_GENERATION_MODEL=provider:model-name
powercontext server run
powercontext capabilities
```

The capability output must report Memory extraction as enabled. Explicit `hermes powercontext remember` writes do not
require a model.
