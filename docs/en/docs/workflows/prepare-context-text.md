# Prepare standard context text

Add `assembly` to `POST /v1/context/prepare` to receive Markdown organized by Artifact family. You can select Memory,
approved Experience, committed Profile snapshots, and Topic Memory, arrange their sections, set entry limits, and display retrieval
rank and confidence status.
Use an existing Scope that you can read; reading referenced Scopes also requires permission.

## Select and order sections

Save this request as `prepare.json`, replacing `scope_id` with your Scope ID:

```json
{
  "scope_id": "project:demo",
  "query": "How should we fix a client mismatch after an OpenAPI change?",
  "max_bytes": 8000,
  "assembly": {
    "format": "markdown",
    "sections": [
      {"family": "experience", "limit": 2},
      {"family": "memory", "limit": 5}
    ],
    "show": ["confidence", "recall_rank"]
  }
}
```

Export the actual text from an unauthenticated local Server. Write the response to a temporary file first and replace
the destination only after both the HTTP request and response validation succeed. This preserves an existing
`context.md` when the request fails:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
tmp_context="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/powercontext-context.XXXXXX")"
trap 'rm -f "$tmp_context"' EXIT
curl --fail-with-body -sS http://127.0.0.1:17429/v1/context/prepare \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @prepare.json \
  | jq -er 'if .status == "empty" then "" elif .status == "ready" and (.content | type) == "string" then .content else error("unexpected prepare response") end' \
  > "$tmp_context"
mv "$tmp_context" context.md
```

Authenticated Servers require the same Authorization header as other API calls. The HTTP envelope still has four
fields: `schema`, `status`, `content`, and `content_bytes`. Write or inject `content` directly. It is already the
final text, including the historical-evidence notice, section headings, literal bodies, exact citations, and
truncation flags. An empty result has `status: "empty"`, `content: null`, and `content_bytes: 0`. HTTP 4xx/5xx
responses or invalid response shapes leave the previous file untouched and return a non-zero exit code.

The equivalent Python request uses the shared Client:

```python
import asyncio
import json
from pathlib import Path

from powercontext.client import PowerContextClient
from powercontext.http import PrepareContextRequest

async def export_context() -> None:
    request = PrepareContextRequest.model_validate(json.loads(Path("prepare.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8")))
    async with PowerContextClient("http://127.0.0.1:17429") as client:
        prepared = await client.prepare_context(request)
    Path("context.md").write_text(prepared.content or "", encoding="utf-8")

asyncio.run(export_context())
```

## Choose the output policy

| Setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Omit `assembly` | Preserve legacy output and selection. |
| `"assembly": {}` | Markdown, Memory up to 6 entries followed by Experience up to 2, no optional metadata. |
| `"assembly": {"sections": []}` | Return an empty result after request and current-Scope checks; perform no candidate recall. |
| One `memory` section | Recall only Memory; its limit is 1–8. |
| One `experience` section | Recall only approved Experience; its limit is 1–2. |
| One `profile` section | Read the latest committed Profile snapshot from each selected Scope; its limit is 1–8. |
| One `topic-memory` section | Search Topic Memory in the current Scope; its limit is 1–8. |
| Two to four sections | Their order controls both presentation and byte-budget priority. Limits must total at most the configured `context_assembly_max_entries` (default 8). |
| `show: ["recall_rank"]` | Display each entry's position in its family's deduplicated candidate list. |
| `show: ["confidence"]` | Display `unknown (not assessed)`; no numerical confidence has been assessed. |

Default prepare requests without `assembly` also recall Topic Memory from the current Scope when available.
With explicit `assembly`, select `topic-memory` to include it. `assembly: {}` still selects only Memory and Experience.

Entries retain retrieval order within a family. Existing Memory reranking remains authoritative. Rank can have gaps
when an earlier entry cannot fit. An excluded family is not recalled. Duplicate families, invalid limits, unsupported
fields such as `sort_by` or `min_confidence`, and explicit `assembly: null` return HTTP 422.

`max_bytes` is the UTF-8 budget for the complete server text: 512–32768, default 8000. Each body is capped at 2000
bytes. When space is insufficient, the Server shortens a body or skips it while retaining complete citations and
boundaries. It may return fewer entries than requested. Hosts must validate the envelope and budget and preserve
the returned text; they must not trim it again. Hosts may add their own notice outside it.

## Configure the combined entry limit

Set the Server environment variable and restart the Server to allow a larger combined selection:

```dotenv
POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_RUNTIME_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_MAX_ENTRIES=16
```

The value must be a positive integer and defaults to 8. Embedded runtimes can set
`BuiltinConfig(runtime=RuntimeConfig(context_assembly_max_entries=16))`.
The receiving Runtime validates the sum before recall; exceeding its configured limit returns HTTP 422.
Each section still allows 1–8 entries, except Experience at 1–2, so the four families can request at most
26 entries combined. This setting does not expand per-family recall pools or the byte budget.
When lowering it below 8, provide explicit section limits whose sum fits: `assembly: {}` still requests
Memory 6 plus Experience 2 and is rejected if that total exceeds the policy. `sections: []` remains valid.
Requests that omit `assembly` retain the legacy selection and eight-entry cap.

## Include Profile snapshots

Select Profile explicitly to put the current Scope's preferences before task memories:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {"family": "profile", "limit": 1},
    {"family": "memory", "limit": 6}
  ]
}
```

Use this object as `assembly` or as a plugin's context assembly setting. Profile is excluded when `assembly` is
omitted or `{}`. Each Profile item is one complete Scope snapshot before the usual body and total-byte limits
are applied. `limit` counts snapshots, not individual preferences. A missing snapshot contributes no item;
`limit: 1` selects the first available snapshot in current-Scope then direct-Context-Reference order.

The Server reads the latest committed `family=profile, artifact_id=profile` revision in each selected Scope.
It does not generate a new Profile, search it using `query`, or include pending/rejected Candidates. It does not
traverse indirect references or subject bindings. Every referenced Scope requires read permission. Revision
citations remain exact after replacements, and a truncated snapshot is marked `Truncated: yes`.
`recall_rank` is its position in the Profile candidate list, not a relevance or confidence score.

## Combine Topic Memory and Profile

Use the following `assembly` to place preferences before relevant topics and other evidence:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {"family": "profile", "limit": 1},
    {"family": "topic-memory", "limit": 2},
    {"family": "memory", "limit": 3},
    {"family": "experience", "limit": 2}
  ]
}
```

Topic Memory uses the existing query-based search in the current Scope. It does not search Context References
or generate new topics during prepare. Each item contains its title, summary, and optional matching snippet,
with the Scope and exact Artifact revision. The full detail remains available through `POST /v1/topic-memory/get`
using that citation. Retrieval order, section limits, optional metadata, and the shared UTF-8 budget apply.

## Enable automatic plugin recall

For Codex, set the JSON object before starting a new session:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY='{"sections":[{"family":"experience","limit":2},{"family":"memory","limit":5}],"show":["confidence","recall_rank"]}'
codex
```

The same request object is available through these integration settings:

| Integration | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` |
| Claude Code | `POWERCONTEXT_CLAUDE_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` |
| WorkBuddy | `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `POWERCONTEXT_DSH_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or plugin `contextAssembly` |
| OpenCode | `POWERCONTEXT_OPENCODE_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` |
| Pi | `POWERCONTEXT_PI_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` |
| Hermes | `POWERCONTEXT_HERMES_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or provider `context_assembly` |
| LangChain | `POWERCONTEXT_LANGCHAIN_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or settings `context_assembly` |
| LangGraph | `POWERCONTEXT_LANGGRAPH_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or settings `context_assembly` |
| Pydantic AI | `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or settings `context_assembly` |
| Bub | `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` or settings `context_assembly` |
| OpenClaw | `plugins.entries.memory-powercontext.config.contextAssembly` as an object |

Environment values are JSON strings; object settings take the equivalent object. Remove the setting to return to
legacy output. Upgrade the Server and relevant integration before enabling it. Older Servers reject `assembly`;
plugins report the failure through their existing diagnostics and do not retry with a broader selection.

The LangChain, LangGraph, and Pydantic AI adapters can use `powercontext==0.2.0` for legacy recall when
`context_assembly` is unset. Enabling it requires a core Client and Server that support text assembly; an older
Client raises a settings validation error. From a checkout containing this feature, install the core and the adapter
together, choosing the adapter directory you use:

```bash
uv pip install ".[client]" ./integrations/langchain
uv pip install ".[client]" ./integrations/langgraph
uv pip install ".[client]" ./integrations/pydantic-ai
```

Hermes applies the configured assembly to automatic recall, the `powercontext_prepare_context` tool, and
`/pc call prepare_context`. Explicit request values override the configured defaults.

LangGraph and Hermes include assembly settings and the byte budget in cache identity. Changing the policy cannot
reuse a prepared result from a different selection or budget. The feature adds no database table or HTTP endpoint.
