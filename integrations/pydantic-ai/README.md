# PowerContext for Pydantic AI

`community`

This directory contains a preview `powercontext-pydantic-ai` adapter. It connects a Pydantic AI agent to a running
PowerContext Server through the public asynchronous Python Client. It provides three tools, prepares relevant context
before model requests, and can optionally capture bounded agent events and flush them into Memory.

## Installation

`experimental`

Install the Client and adapter from the same source ref in your application environment. This example uses OpenAI:

```bash
uv add "powercontext[client] @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master"
uv add "powercontext-pydantic-ai @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master#subdirectory=integrations/pydantic-ai"
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]>=2.29,<3"
```

Start a separate PowerContext Server from the same ref. The source adapter requires `powercontext[client]>=0.0.3`.
For another provider, replace the `openai` extra and model string.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from powercontext_pydantic_ai import PowerContext

agent = Agent(
    "openai:gpt-5.2",
    capabilities=[PowerContext()],
)
result = agent.run_sync("Which API constraints have we already agreed on?")
print(result.output)
```

`PowerContext` contributes these model tools:

- `powercontext_search(query, limit=10, mode="auto")`
- `powercontext_remember(text, kind="agent-note", reason=None)`
- `powercontext_context(query)`

Each tool returns the complete public HTTP response as JSON, including citations, status, and revision fields. Client
failures become Pydantic AI `ModelRetry` signals instead of empty search results. To install only the tools without
automatic recall or capture, pass `PowerContextToolset()` through the Agent's `toolsets=` argument.

## Configuration

Environment variables use the `POWERCONTEXT_PYDANTIC_AI_` prefix.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:17429` | PowerContext Server HTTP base URL |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | `false` | Explicitly allow non-loopback HTTP; HTTPS certificate validation stays enabled |
| `TOKEN` | unset | Bare Server token; the Client adds the `Bearer` scheme |
| `SCOPE_ID` | unset | Existing explicit Server Scope; unset selects the Server default |
| `TIMEOUT` | `10` | HTTP timeout in seconds |
| `MAX_BYTES` | `8000` | Maximum prepared-context bytes |
| `CAPTURE_EVENTS` | `false` | Capture visible agent trajectory events as Sources |
| `CAPTURE_CHECKPOINT_EVERY` | `5` | Flush after this many successful captures |
| `CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES` | `8192` | UTF-8 byte limit for one captured event |

The `TOKEN` value is deliberately different from the Codex and Claude Code plugin authorization settings: provide
only the opaque token, not `Bearer TOKEN` or a complete `Authorization` header. It is stored as Pydantic `SecretStr`
and passed to `PowerContextClient`, which constructs the header.

`PowerContextSettings(allow_insecure_http=True)` also permits non-loopback HTTP. Transport settings resolve from
constructor values, host environment, common `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_SERVER_URL` /
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`, then the `pydantic-ai` entry in `~/.config/powercontext/clients.json`
(overridden by `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`). A host value of `false` overrides common `true`.
Saved consent applies only to its saved Server URL and is not reused when the URL changes.

Both components accept `settings=`, `id=` (default `powercontext`), and `scope_id=`. `scope_id` can be a fixed string
or a callable receiving the current `RunContext`. Resolution order is constructor value or callback, then environment
`SCOPE_ID`. The adapter sends that explicit ID, or `None`, to the Server's `resolve_scope_binding` operation once per
run and reuses the returned Scope ID throughout the run. Unset configuration selects the Server default. Explicit
IDs must already identify a Server Scope. The adapter never inspects the working directory, Git repository, or path
to create an ID. A callback is evaluated once per run.

## Recall, capture, and trust

Automatic recall uses the latest textual user prompt and prepends one current-run system request containing bounded
prepared context. That block is explicitly labeled untrusted historical evidence. Recall, capture, and flush fail
open when the Server is unavailable; explicit Memory tools still surface `ModelRetry` so the model can recover.

Capture is disabled by default. Enabling `CAPTURE_EVENTS=true` means you consent to sending the initial user text,
visible model text and tool calls, and completed tool arguments and results to the configured PowerContext scope.
Thinking/reasoning parts are excluded. Credential-like keys, known credential environment values, and Codex auth
values are redacted, but ordinary prompts and tool results can still contain sensitive project data. Captured events
use schema `powercontext.pydantic-ai-capture-event/v1`, are byte-bounded, and are flushed at checkpoints and after the
run.

PowerContext MCP requires no Pydantic AI-specific package and remains a useful lower-capability alternative. It does
not provide automatic `prepare_context`, trajectory capture, or checkpoint/final flush. Temporal, DBOS, Prefect, and
other durable-execution integrations have not been validated for the preview. Handoff, Candidate Review, Experience,
and Skill operations are outside this adapter's scope.
