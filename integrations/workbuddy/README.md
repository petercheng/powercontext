# PowerContext integration for WorkBuddy

`community`

This directory contains a thin WorkBuddy integration backed by a running
PowerContext server. It does not embed storage or start the server. WorkBuddy
keeps the user interface and agent orchestration while PowerContext provides
external storage, retrieval, context preparation, Memory, and Handoff lifecycle
operations.

The integration has three capability layers:

- a `UserPromptSubmit` hook asks the Runtime to prepare one final, bounded
  context value before WorkBuddy analyzes the prompt, then independently
  captures the prompt as Source evidence;
- Streamable HTTP MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:17429/mcp` gives WorkBuddy explicit
  Memory and work-continuity tools (`search_memory`, `list_memory_entries`,
  `handoff_current_work`, `commit_handoff`, and so on);
- the `powercontext-project-context` Skill turns an imperative such as `交接`,
  `交接当前工作`, or `handoff this work` into one durable, committed Handoff,
  and restores project memory for continued work.

The hooks driver is pure Python 3.11+ standard library and needs no extra
dependencies. WorkBuddy support ships with a `powercontext setup workbuddy`
CLI installer; the manual steps below remain available as a fallback.

## Install with the PowerContext CLI

Install the hooks, MCP server, and Skill from a local checkout or a GitHub
source in one step:

```bash
powercontext setup workbuddy --source oceanbase/powercontext --ref master
```

For a local checkout, point `--source` at the repository root or the plugin
directory:

```bash
powercontext setup workbuddy --source /path/to/powercontext
```

The installer copies the hook driver, its settings modules, and the scope
resolver into `~/.workbuddy/hooks`, merges the `UserPromptSubmit` hook into
`~/.workbuddy/settings.json`, registers the `powercontext` server in
`~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`, and installs the `powercontext-project-context` Skill under
`~/.workbuddy/skills`. Existing settings and other MCP servers are preserved,
and the Skill's command placeholders are resolved automatically.
Verify the result with `powercontext doctor workbuddy`.

### Manual installation

These steps copy the plugin into the WorkBuddy user directory, register the
hook and the MCP server, install the Skill, and verify the integration.

#### 1. Copy the plugin files

WorkBuddy loads hook commands from its user-level hooks directory. Copy the
hook driver, its settings modules, and the scope resolver there. This guide
uses `~/.workbuddy/hooks` as the hooks directory; replace it with your own
location and use the same value wherever `<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>` appears below.
Use the Python executable that can import PowerContext wherever
`<POWERCONTEXT_PYTHON>` appears below.

```bash
PLUGIN=integrations/workbuddy/plugins/powercontext
WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR="${WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR:-$HOME/.workbuddy/hooks}"

mkdir -p "$WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR"
cp "$PLUGIN"/hooks/workbuddy_powercontext_hook.py \
   "$PLUGIN"/hooks/workbuddy_settings.py \
   "$PLUGIN"/hooks/powercontext_client_config.py \
   "$PLUGIN"/hooks/prepared_context.py \
   "$WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR"/
cp "$PLUGIN/scripts/workspace_scope.py" \
   "$WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR/powercontext_scope_binding.py"
```

The resulting layout is:

```text
<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>/
  workbuddy_powercontext_hook.py
  workbuddy_settings.py
  powercontext_client_config.py
  prepared_context.py
  powercontext_scope_binding.py
```

#### 2. Register the hook

Merge the following `hooks` block into `~/.workbuddy/settings.json`. Replace
`<POWERCONTEXT_PYTHON>` with the Python executable that can import PowerContext,
and `<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>` with the absolute path of your hooks directory (for
example `/Users/<you>/.workbuddy/hooks`). The command string cannot expand
environment variables, so literal paths are required here.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<POWERCONTEXT_PYTHON>\" \"<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>/workbuddy_powercontext_hook.py\"",
            "timeout": 30,
            "statusMessage": "Syncing PowerContext"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A complete sample is included at
`plugins/powercontext/hooks/hooks.workbuddy.json`.

#### 3. Register the MCP server

Merge the following `mcpServers` entry into `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powercontext": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_SERVER_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:17429}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "${POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_AUTHORIZATION:-}"
      },
      "description": "PowerContext agent memory & handoff MCP server (local service on port 17429)"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Install the Skill

Copy the `powercontext-project-context` Skill into the WorkBuddy skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.workbuddy/skills
cp -R integrations/workbuddy/plugins/powercontext/skills/powercontext-project-context \
  ~/.workbuddy/skills/
cat > ~/.workbuddy/skills/powercontext-project-context/.powercontext.json <<'EOF'
{"schema": 1, "owner": "powercontext", "integration": "workbuddy"}
EOF
```

Then open `~/.workbuddy/skills/powercontext-project-context/SKILL.md`. Replace
`${POWERCONTEXT_PYTHON}` with a shell-safe Python executable argument and
`${POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_BINDING_SCRIPT}` with a shell-safe complete path to
`<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>/powercontext_scope_binding.py`.

#### 5. Start the Server, restart WorkBuddy, and verify

Keep the PowerContext Server running in one terminal:

```bash
powercontext server run
```

Restart WorkBuddy so it picks up the new hook, MCP server, and Skill. Send any
prompt; the hook reports `Syncing PowerContext` while it runs. To verify the
recall contract directly, inspect the Server logs or run:

```bash
powercontext doctor
```

The MCP tools (`search_memory` and the Handoff tools) become available in the
WorkBuddy session when the Server is reachable.

## Configuration

The hook uses `http://127.0.0.1:17429` by default. Environment variables
override the defaults; restart WorkBuddy after changing them.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_SERVER_URL` | PowerContext server URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:17429`). |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | Explicit non-loopback HTTP consent; overrides common and saved consent, including `false`. |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_AUTHORIZATION` | Complete authorization header, e.g. `Bearer <token>` |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_SCOPE_ID` | Explicit server-owned Scope ID |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_CAPTURE_PROMPTS` | Capture user prompts as Sources (default `true`) |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_FLUSH_ON_CAPTURE` | Flush until the captured Source is processed (testing only, default `false`) |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Per-request HTTP timeout (default `1.0`) |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_HTTP_BUDGET_SECONDS` | Shared wall-clock budget for one prompt (default `4.0`) |
| `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_FLUSH_MAX_CALLS` | Maximum flush calls (default `4`) |

The hook selects its URL from `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_SERVER_URL`,
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_SERVER_URL`, saved settings, then the loopback default.
It removes a final `/mcp` suffix and rejects credentials, query strings, and
fragments. HTTPS and loopback HTTP work by default. To persist a non-loopback
HTTP endpoint and configure the native MCP URL consistently:

```bash
powercontext setup workbuddy --server-url http://memory.example:8000 --allow-insecure-http
```

Nonsecret settings are stored under `hosts.workbuddy` in
`~/.config/powercontext/clients.json`; `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` overrides
the location. Saved consent applies only to the same normalized endpoint.
An explicit settings constructor argument overrides the host environment,
then `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`, then saved consent. Boolean
misspellings are rejected, and explicit `false` disables inherited consent.

The guard applies to the PowerContext hook; WorkBuddy owns native MCP transport
policy. HTTP sends request content and authorization headers without encryption.
HTTPS certificate verification remains enabled.

## Runtime behavior

- Recall calls `POST /v1/context/prepare` once per prompt, requests an
  8000-byte total budget, strictly validates `powercontext.prepared-context.v1`,
  and injects the returned content unchanged as untrusted history.
- Capture independently posts the prompt to `POST /v1/sources/content` with
  stable, content-addressed `source_id` values.
- Recall, capture, and flush fail independently. An unavailable Server never
  blocks normal WorkBuddy work.
- For an empty result, authentication failure, version mismatch, unavailable
  Server, or invalid response, the hook writes one diagnostic JSON line to
  stderr. Diagnostics contain status and byte counts only—never the query,
  scope, content, citation, response body, or authorization value.

## Authentication

Optional local bearer authentication uses `POWERCONTEXT_WORKBUDDY_AUTHORIZATION`,
whose value must be a complete `Bearer <token>` header. `.mcp.json` stores only
an environment-variable template for the Authorization value; WorkBuddy expands
it from the environment, and the hook reads the same variable. Missing or empty
values preserve the default unauthenticated flow. Never put the token itself in
`.mcp.json` or the Server URL.

## Manual uninstallation

1. Remove the `UserPromptSubmit` PowerContext entry from `~/.workbuddy/settings.json`.
2. Remove the `powercontext` entry from `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`.
3. Remove the hook files and the scope resolver from `<WORKBUDDY_HOOKS_DIR>`.
4. Remove `~/.workbuddy/skills/powercontext-project-context`.
5. Optionally stop the Server and delete its local data directory.
