# PowerContext for Codex

This plugin is a thin Codex integration for a running PowerContext Server. It
does not embed storage or start the server.

The integration uses each public surface for the job it fits:

- the `UserPromptSubmit` hook first calls `POST /v1/context/prepare`, then
  independently captures the current prompt with `POST /v1/sources/content`;
- Streamable HTTP MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:17429/mcp` gives Codex the curated
  Memory and work-continuity tools.

Codex does not expose a plugin-defined status-line item. Its `tui.status_line`
setting accepts only Codex's built-in identifiers, so this plugin does not write
an invalid PowerContext identifier. Instead, a ten-second-bounded `Stop` Hook shows
the current scope's estimated token reduction after each completed turn, for
example `PowerContext · saved 1.2k today · saved 12k in 30d`. When the Server is
unavailable it prints one deduplicated, content-free diagnostic instead of the
savings line, and it never asks Codex to continue the turn.
The message is an interactive TUI warning rather than a persistent footer item;
non-interactive `codex exec` confirms Hook completion but does not render the
Hook message in its text output.

The numbers come from the recall-token estimator and are a per-call compression
proxy, not provider-verified or billable savings. Positive reductions use
`saved`; negative reductions use `cost`.

The `powercontext-project-context` skill uses four high-level work operations instead of
assembling the low-level Handoff lifecycle manually: `create_work_contract`,
`handoff_current_work`, `acknowledge_handoff`, and `record_task_outcome`.
When the user says `交接`, `交接当前工作`, `handoff this work`, or an equivalent
imperative, the Skill inspects the current conversation and repository, calls
`handoff_current_work`, and immediately commits the returned `handoff` member
through the artifact-level `commit_handoff` operation. The imperative itself
is the explicit authorization
for that durable milestone; preview or design requests remain read-only.
Acknowledgements and historical authorization notes never grant Codex new
execution authority, and the prompt hook does not infer completion from Stop or
SessionEnd.

Managed Skills use a separate, explicit handoff. Set `POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID` to the existing Scope ID that owns the
approved Revision. A reviewer approves the exact
Candidate through HTTP or the Client CLI, then the user exports that immutable
Skill Revision into a Codex Skill directory:

```bash
powercontext skill export \
  --target codex \
  --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" \
  --revision 1 \
  --destination .agents/skills/example-skill \
  SKILL_ID
```

The command creates `SKILL.md` and a `powercontext.json` manifest containing the
exact Artifact reference and content hash. It never replaces an existing path.
Approval alone neither installs nor executes a Skill, and Review operations are
not exposed to the agent through MCP.

Start a local server before using the integration:

```bash
powercontext server run
```

The hook runtime is declared by the plugin's `pyproject.toml` and launched with
`uv`; this keeps its `pydantic-settings` dependency isolated and reproducible.
The hook uses a small synchronous standard-library HTTP adapter because Codex
executes it as a short-lived process. It does not expose that adapter as an SDK.
`SessionStart` fixes a durable binding from an explicit plugin Scope, an
existing Session binding, a workspace binding preference, or the Server's
default Scope. `UserPromptSubmit` uses that binding for recall and capture.
`PreToolUse` injects the same binding into PowerContext data-plane tools, so an
Agent-supplied `scope_id` cannot redirect a write. Repository and directory
identities are binding lookup inputs only; they never generate a Scope ID.

Set `POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_SCOPE_ID` only when the host must explicitly bind every
request to one known Scope.
`.mcp.json` is the single Server endpoint configuration consumed by Codex and
the hook: the hook validates its PowerContext MCP URL and derives the HTTP API
base by removing the final `/mcp` path segment. Change that file before
installing the plugin when the loopback default is not appropriate. MCP URLs
cannot contain credentials, query strings, or fragments. Plain HTTP is accepted
for loopback hosts by default. To configure a non-loopback HTTP server explicitly:

```bash
powercontext setup codex --server-url http://memory.example:8000 --allow-insecure-http
```

Setup saves nonsecret client settings under `hosts.codex` in
`~/.config/powercontext/clients.json` (`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` overrides
the path) and configures the installed MCP endpoint. Saved HTTP consent applies
only to that endpoint, ignoring trailing slashes and the `/mcp` suffix.
`POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` overrides
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`, including an explicit `false`; both
override saved consent. Invalid boolean values are rejected. A direct
`CodexPluginSettings(allow_insecure_http=...)` argument has highest priority.
The MCP file remains authoritative for the URL; a URL environment variable
does not redirect the hook independently of MCP.

This setting governs PowerContext's hook HTTP requests. Codex owns the native
MCP transport and its policy. HTTP sends request content and any authorization
header without encryption; this opt-in does not disable HTTPS certificate
verification.

The hook strictly validates `powercontext.prepared-context.v1`, rejects redirects,
caps response bodies at 1 MiB, and applies both per-request and shared wall-clock
deadlines. The Runtime owns final selection, rendering, exact citations, and the
8000-byte output budget; the hook injects validated content unchanged.

Optional local bearer authentication uses `POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_AUTHORIZATION`,
whose value must be a complete `Bearer <token>` header. `powercontext setup
codex` saves a URL-bound credential under
`~/.codex/powercontext/credentials.json`; on Windows it also writes the matching
value to the current user's environment so a restarted Codex Desktop can resolve
the native MCP header. The hook reads the saved record, while an explicit process
value overrides it. Missing credentials preserve the default unauthenticated
flow. Never put the token in `.mcp.json`, the Server URL, or a static MCP header.

Prompt capture is enabled by default. Set `POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_CAPTURE_PROMPTS=false`
when prompts must not be persisted. Captured Sources are normally processed by
the Server's Memory extraction job. They remain ordinary prompt evidence: the
hook does not label a user request as a completed Task Outcome.
For tests or read-your-write workflows, set
`POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_FLUSH_ON_CAPTURE=true`; the hook then flushes until the captured
Source position is processed.

Scheduled Experience incubation is a separate Server job. It consumes only
Content Sources captured by a completion-aware integration with metadata
`{"kind": "task-outcome"}` and creates pending Experience Candidates for the
Review Inbox. It never approves an Experience, creates or installs a managed
Skill, or grants Codex execution authority.

All hook configuration uses the `POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_` prefix. The default
request timeout is one second, the shared HTTP budget is four seconds, and a
flush performs at most four calls. These can be tuned with
`POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
`POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_HTTP_BUDGET_SECONDS`, and
`POWERCONTEXT_CODEX_FLUSH_MAX_CALLS`, while the outer Codex hook remains capped
at ten seconds.

Context returned by the hook is labelled as untrusted history. Recall, capture,
and flush fail independently; an unavailable Server never blocks normal Codex
work. For an empty result, authentication failure, version mismatch, unavailable
Server, or invalid response, the hook returns one content-free diagnostic JSON event through the top-level
`systemMessage` in its successful stdout response. If context is available, `hookSpecificOutput` is returned beside
the diagnostic. Repeated failures are deduplicated per invocation and throttled for 60 seconds across hook processes.
Diagnostics contain status and byte counts only—never the query, scope, content,
citation, response body, or authorization value.
