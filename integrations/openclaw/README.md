# OpenClaw integration

`community`

`plugins/memory-powercontext` contains the PowerContext memory plugin for
[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). The plugin registers a `memory` capability backed by a running
PowerContext Server: bounded recall before each prompt, capture of eligible user prompts as Source evidence, and
explicit `powercontext_memory_*` tools for durable Memory operations, Work Contracts, and Handoffs.

The plugin talks HTTP only. It never starts or embeds a PowerContext Server, and an unavailable Server never blocks
normal OpenClaw work.

## Requirements

- OpenClaw 2026.8.1-beta.2 or newer, available on `PATH`
- Node.js 24.15 or newer in the 24.x line (recommended by the supported OpenClaw release) and `pnpm`
- A running PowerContext Server (see `powercontext server run`)

## Install or refresh the plugin

Install the CLI and plugin from the same `master` revision:

```bash
uv tool install --force "powercontext[cli,server] @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@master"
powercontext setup openclaw --source oceanbase/powercontext --ref master
```

Without `--server-url`, setup configures the plugin for the Server default at `http://127.0.0.1:17429`.

A local checkout works as well:

```bash
powercontext setup openclaw --source .
```

`setup openclaw` builds the plugin with pnpm, installs it with `openclaw plugins install --link --force`, enables it as
the `memory` plugin slot, adds the PowerContext tools to `tools.alsoAllow`, and restarts the OpenClaw gateway. It does
not start the Server.

Start the Server, then start a new OpenClaw session:

```bash
powercontext server run
openclaw
```

To use a Server that actually listens on another port:

```bash
powercontext setup openclaw --server-url http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Run `setup openclaw` again to refresh an existing installation.

## Understand what the plugin does

Before OpenClaw builds a prompt, the plugin calls `POST /v1/context/prepare` once with an 8000-byte default budget.
Recalled content is labelled as untrusted historical evidence; current system instructions, repository guidance, and
the user's request always take precedence.

Explicit memory reads bypass preparation. Search calls `/v1/memory/search`, limits the query to 8192 characters, and
clamps the requested result limit to 1–50 (default 10). Get calls `/v1/memory/entries/get` and returns at most 120
lines and 12,000 characters per read.

Eligible user prompts from direct/private sessions are captured separately as Content Sources with a deterministic
source id, so repeated captures are idempotent. Group, channel, and incognito sessions are excluded. The plugin never
synchronizes the complete OpenClaw transcript. Recall, capture, and boundary flushing fail open: an unavailable
Server, timeout, redirect, or invalid response leaves the prompt unchanged and never blocks ordinary work.

The plugin exposes five tools: `powercontext_memory_search`, `powercontext_memory_get`,
`powercontext_memory_store`, `powercontext_memory_revise`, and `powercontext_memory_retire`. Mutating tools
(`store`, `revise`, `retire`) are marked side-effecting in the plugin manifest.

It also registers the `/pc` command for WebUI and other OpenClaw command surfaces. `/pc` and `/pc help` show the
available controls; `/pc status` checks Server readiness and capabilities. The agent tools add a high-level Work
Contract and Handoff flow: create a contract, prepare the current work boundary, explicitly commit or continue a
Handoff, acknowledge the receiver checks, and record the Task Outcome. Work Contract and Handoff content remains
untrusted input or history. Preparing a current-work Handoff records its boundary evidence; committing the Handoff,
acknowledging receipt, and recording the outcome are explicit durable workflow steps.

## Memory scope

The plugin asks the Server to resolve one existing Scope before every operation. Resolution uses an explicit
`scopeId`, then durable bindings for the OpenClaw session, ordered active projects, and agent identity, followed by
the Server's default Scope. These host identities are lookup inputs only; the plugin never turns an agent, project,
path, or session into a Scope ID and never creates a Scope.

To select an existing Scope explicitly for every OpenClaw operation, configure its opaque ID and restart the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.memory-powercontext.config.scopeId scp_0123456789abcdefghjkmnpqrs
openclaw gateway restart
```

Without `scopeId`, provision durable bindings on the Server when the host identity must retain a selection; otherwise
the ordinary Server default is used. The plugin does not persist bindings because OpenClaw currently exposes no Scope
selection contract.

## Connect to an authenticated Server

Start an authenticated Server from a protected environment:

```bash
export POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_ACCESS_MODE=enforced
export POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN="$POWERCONTEXT_LOCAL_TOKEN"
powercontext server run
```

The plugin reads the Bearer token from the environment variable named by the `tokenEnv` config entry, which defaults
to `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_API_TOKEN`. The Gateway service must receive that variable in its own environment. Add the
matching secret value to the Gateway service environment or to `~/.openclaw/.env`:

```dotenv
POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_API_TOKEN=<same token value>
```

Protect the file and restart the Gateway so the plugin receives the updated environment:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/.env
openclaw gateway restart
```

Do not put credentials in the endpoint. Remote HTTP is rejected by default. For an explicitly trusted plaintext
connection, set `POWERCONTEXT_OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` or the plugin setting `allowInsecureHttp: true`.
The common `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` flag applies when the host flag is absent; a host flag of
`false` overrides it. Flags accept only `true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, or `on/off`.
HTTPS certificate validation remains enabled, and the plugin rejects redirects.

Setup-saved URLs and endpoint-specific consent are read from `~/.config/powercontext/clients.json`
(override with `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`). `POWERCONTEXT_OPENCLAW_BASE_URL`, then
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_SERVER_URL`, take precedence over an explicit plugin endpoint and the saved URL.
Changing the endpoint does not reuse saved or native HTTP consent. Native `allowInsecureHttp: true` must accompany
the matching `endpoint`; an environment URL override needs its own matching or explicit environment consent.

## Verify the installation

```bash
powercontext doctor
powercontext doctor openclaw
```

`doctor openclaw` checks that the OpenClaw CLI is available and that `openclaw plugins list --enabled --json` reports
`memory-powercontext` as loaded and selected for the memory slot. Restart the OpenClaw gateway after changing
PowerContext configuration.

## Development

Build and test the plugin from this repository:

```bash
make openclaw-plugin-build
```

Run the plugin unit tests and the CLI tests:

```bash
pnpm --dir integrations/openclaw/plugins/memory-powercontext test
uv run pytest tests/test_openclaw_cli.py
```

## Optional workflow Skill

The package includes `powercontext-project-context`, discovered through the plugin manifest's `skills` directory.
Its English/Chinese description routes Memory and work-transfer requests to local reference files. Read details only
when needed; ordinary coding requires no Skill detour. The Skill does not enable unavailable tools, Memory inventory,
candidate Review, or writes outside the host's private-session and permission boundaries.
