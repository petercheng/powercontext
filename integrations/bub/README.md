# PowerContext for Bub

`evaluation`

This package connects Bub to a running PowerContext Server through the public Python client. It adds three tools:

- `powercontext.remember` stores one durable decision, preference, constraint, or procedure.
- `powercontext.search` searches durable memory.
- `powercontext.context` prepares bounded context for a question.

Before each model call, the plugin also prepares relevant context and adds it as host-supplied historical evidence.
Automatic trajectory capture is opt-in. When enabled, the plugin captures the initial task and completed LLM and tool
events as bounded Content Sources. It periodically flushes those Sources through the Memory pipeline so later model
steps in the same Bub run can recall earlier findings. Provider-hidden reasoning is never available to the hook and is
not captured.

## Configuration

The plugin uses Bub's Pydantic settings extension. Configuration can live in the `powercontext` section of Bub's
configuration file:

```yaml
powercontext:
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:17429
  capture_events: true
  capture_checkpoint_every: 5
```

Environment variables use the `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_` prefix and take precedence over file values. Values are parsed and
validated by Pydantic before the plugin starts.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:17429` | PowerContext Server URL |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | `false` | Explicitly allow non-loopback HTTP for recall, capture, and tools; HTTPS certificate validation stays enabled |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_SCOPE_ID` | unset | Explicit Scope resolved and validated by the Server before use |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Client timeout in seconds |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_MAX_BYTES` | `8000` | Maximum prepared-context size |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY` | unset | JSON object selecting prepared-context families and output options |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CAPTURE_EVENTS` | `false` | Capture completed Bub events as Content Sources |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CAPTURE_CHECKPOINT_EVERY` | `5` | Flush Memory after this many captured events |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES` | `8192` | Maximum UTF-8 bytes stored for one captured event |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_CAPTURE_LOG` | unset | Optional JSONL evidence path; records metadata but not event content |
| `POWERCONTEXT_BUB_TRUST_TRANSPORT_SECURITY` | `false` | Vouch for a plaintext non-loopback `BASE_URL` on an operator-controlled network (for example a private Compose bridge); otherwise such URLs are refused |

`PowerContextSettings(allow_insecure_http=True)` also permits non-loopback HTTP. Transport settings resolve from
constructor values, host environment, common `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_SERVER_URL` /
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`, then the `bub` entry in `~/.config/powercontext/clients.json`
(overridden by `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`). A host value of `false` overrides common `true`.
Saved consent applies only to its saved Server URL and is not reused when the URL changes.

The plugin never derives a Scope ID from the current directory, Git metadata, or a workspace path. It asks the Server
to resolve the configured explicit Scope first, then an opaque stable binding key derived from Bub's workspace identity,
and finally the Server default. Only the real Scope returned by the Server is cached and used for recall, capture, and
tools.

Captured tool arguments redact values under credential-like keys. Known credential environment values are also
removed from serialized event content. Keep the PowerContext scope and optional capture log protected because normal
tool output can still contain sensitive project data.

Install the package together with PowerContext and Bub:

```bash
uv pip install -e . -e integrations/bub
```

Legacy context retrieval remains available with `powercontext==0.2.0` when `context_assembly` is unset.
Text assembly requires a core and Server that support it; install the core and plugin together from the same checkout
using the command above. On an older core, configuring assembly raises an explicit upgrade message at startup.
